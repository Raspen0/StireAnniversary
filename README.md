# StireAnniversary #

StireAnniversary is a Spigot/Paper plugin that was made in 2021 to handle the features of the 10th anniversary of [Stirebuild](https://stirebuild.com).

In 2021 the idea was to temporarily bring back all the previous server worlds for the 10th anniversary. And also for players to be able to teleport to their previous homes. But Stirebuild has had many types of player made teleport points in the past: **Essentials /home**, **Minecraft beds**, **Factions**, **Towny**.
So this plugin was made to handle importing data from all these sources from the old worlds so players can easily teleport to their old homes.
In addition, it prevents changes to containers in those anniversary worlds.

This plugin is dependent on StireTweaks for language handling.
This is a closed source plugin that handles most of the Stirebuild features.
